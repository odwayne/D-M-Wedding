        <h2>Our Story</h2>

        <div class="col-sm-12">
          <br />
          <p>
          Depending on who you ask, you may get 2 different stories about how we first met. But we agree on one thing: we met in 2009 and have been inseparable ever since. We maintained a long distance relationship for 2 years, while Darnell was attending school at Savannah State University in Savannah and  I was attending Georgia State University in Atlanta. Thank God for flight benefits, as Darnell was able to fly to Atlanta to see me almost every weekend. After 2 years, Darnell transferred to the Georgia Institute Of Technology and moved to Atlanta.
          <br /><br />
          Even though we are very different; Darnell being from New York and being a man and I being from Cleveland and a woman, we share lots of the same beliefs and interests. We are AVID basketball fans. The only difference with this is he likes the Lakers, me, not so much. We also share the same belief that hard work is the key to success. We are both currently trying to expand our education. Darnell eventually wants to go to Graduate School to continue his studies in Computers and I eventually want to go to Law School. We both are very driven individuals and that helps a lot in our relationship as we motivate each other to not slack in life.
          <br /><br />
          We are very excited that after 6 years, we will finally be tying the knot!

        <div class="col-sm-12">
          <br /><p>
            We got engaged on Valentine’s Day 2015. Darnell came upstairs to serve me breakfast in bed. I did not think this was anything out of the ordinary as he does this pretty often. I had just woken up and barely had my eyes open to read the words on the plate, but he had written “4EVER?” with pancake batter. I was taken aback by this as I didn’t believe what was happening. After seconds of staring at the plate in shock, I said YES! The rest of the story is history, as they would say it.
